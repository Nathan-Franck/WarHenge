	Simple Game
		Top Down Shooter
			ABA games style: procedural, simple graphics
			Creating and destroying entities
			Entity collision system
			Health and Damage components
			Score system, Point components
		Platformer
			Tileset system
			Simple physics
			Procedural Tiles?
				Grass tiles created by rendering many lines onto render texture
				Animated tiles
				Simple no frills art style, flat coloring, but nice shapes
				Each tile is a display function, with a defined loop period for prerendering/caching
				Tiles could all be rendered out for production game, or kept for faster download, more client processing, given correct browser and OS
				= Intensely detailed programmer art!
				This could expand to arbitrary images that are made up of smaller procedures
					MovieClip extends Renderer {
						#Upon definition, adds itself to MovieClipSystem's asset list
						Length #Defines length of movieclip
						Bounds #min and max x, y values - a tile might be 1x1 meter, centered at 0,0
						PreRender = True #Default prerenders
						PreRenderedFrames #Frames stored here
						Display(RenderTarget, Time) #Display Function
						
					}
					MovieClipSystem {
						MovieClipAssetList
						PreRender(FramesPerSecond, ResolutionPerMeter) #Renders out everything in the list
					}
				Random note: Is there a 3D alternative for this process? It's basically rasterizing and quantizing something that's normally vector and infinitesimal - so... turning a 3D model into a 3D texture I suppose - 4D including animation. Although the assumption is that the rasterization will result in an increased performance, whereas tracing through a 3D texture is usually more intensive, unless the volume is a really small segment of the screen and the steps are pretty small.
