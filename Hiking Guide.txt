			Procedural Tiles?
				Grass tiles created by rendering many lines onto render texture
				Animated tiles
				Simple no frills art style, flat coloring, but nice shapes
				Each tile is a display function, with a defined loop period for prerendering/caching
				Tiles could all be rendered out for production game, or kept for faster download, more client processing, given correct browser and OS
				= Intensely detailed programmer art!
				This could expand to arbitrary images that are made up of smaller procedures
